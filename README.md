## The Story
As a young 19 year old kid, you listen to hip-hop 24/7. You are always talking to your friends about your favorite artists, and are always trying to go see them perform live. You wish that you could be rich and famous and hang out with these artists you follow on social media obsessively.

One day you decide that it’s time the world know your name. You create an account on Soundcloud, purchase a cheap microphone off of Amazon and download the free sound recording and editing software Audacity.

You know that in order to fulfil your wildest dreams and become famous, you need to gain a following and earn notoriety, or “clout”. The road ahead is long and arduous, but the prize is everything you ever wanted.
